## Simulation of physical quantum systems from scratch
Right now this is entanglement swapping and teleportation.
## Using IBM's OPENQASM platform to simulate quantum entanglement. 
The files for this project are entanglement-swapping.py and teleportation.py. 
## Requirements
The "requirements" files are use for input to Pip to build virtual environments for the two projects
