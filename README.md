# Two Entanglement Projects
## Using the Qutip System to Simulate Teleportation
This is all in the file qutip_teleportation.py, plus the utility function same_state (in physical_simulation_utilities.py) that verifies that the state has been reconstructed.
## Using IBM's OPENQASM platform to simulate quantum entanglement. 
The files for this project are entanglement-swapping.py and teleportation.py. 
## Simulation of physical quantum systems from scratch
Right now this is entanglement swapping and teleportation.
## Requirements
The "requirements" files are use for input to Pip to build virtual environments for the two projects
