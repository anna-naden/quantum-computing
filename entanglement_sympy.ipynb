    "# Quantum Teleportaton and Entanglement Swapping Using Sympy\n",
    "This first part of this notebook demonstrates teleportation of a quantum state following the classic paper in Physical Review Letters: *Teleporting an Unknown State via Dual Classical and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosent Channels*, 29 March 1993, Vol. 70, #13, p. 1895\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no numbers in this computation - it is all algebra perfomed automatically using sympy, numpy and sicpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice has a particle in a state unknown to her and she wishes to communicate that state to Bob by entangling it with a second particle and sending that particle to Bob. In order for Bob to decode the state, he needs two bits of classical information from Alice - her measurement results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> Alice prepares particles two and there in an entngled Bell state singlet state.</li>\n",
    "    <li> Alice measures partciles one and two in the Bell basis, getting one of four possible outcomes.</li>\n",
    "    <li> Bob receives the measurement results and depending on their value, chooses a gate to apply to particle three.</li>\n",
    "    <li> Particle three is now in a replica state matching the original state of particle one.\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook computes the state of particle three before and after Bob applies his gate and demonstrates that the state of particle three is an exact replica of the initial state of particle one, verifying equations (5) and (6) in the paper. To do so, it defines Python classes for quantum states and operators and overloads the multiplication operator to perform quantum operations and tensor products of quantum operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of this notebook, Entanglement Swapping, applies the teleportation technique to a more complicated\n",
    "situation: the quantum Internet. There is a transmitting station, a receiving station and a quantum repeater between them. There are five qubits - the data qubit, three link qubits and the received qubit, which is placed in \n",
    "an exact replica of the data qubit. In accordance with the no-cloning principle, the data qubit is destroyed when \n",
    "it is transmitted."
