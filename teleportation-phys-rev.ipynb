    "Alice and Bob met long ago but now live far apart. While together they generated an EPR pair of entangled particles (particles two and three), each taking one qubit of the pair when they separated. Many years later, Bob is in hiding, and Aliceâ€™s mission is to precisely deliver a qubit (the state of particle one) $\\ket{\\Psi}$ to Bob. She does not know the state of the qubit, and moreover can only send classical information to Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks impossible; she doesn't know the state of particle one and because of quantum mechanics, she cannot determine it (measurement can only give her a single classical bit - one or zero). Besides that, even if she knew the values of amplitudes of the qubit, she would need an infinite number of classical bits to precisely communicate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how they do it:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> Alice entangles particles two and three. Partice one, the qubit, is in an unknown state</li>\n",
    "    <li> Bob takes particle three to a distant galaxy</li>\n",
    "    <li> Alice measures the state of the qubit (particle one) and her particle (particle two), getting two classical bits of information</li>\n",
    "    <li> Alice send the classical bits to Bob</li>\n",
    "    <li> Bob uses the classical bits to select one of four physical operations</li>\n",
    "    <li> Bob performs the operation on his particle (particle three). These operations are simulated here using quantum computing gates</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that his particle is now in the exact state that particle one was in before Alice measured it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are thre points to note:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> After Alice and Bob separated, Alice does not need to send anything to Bob except for the two classical bits</li>\n",
    "    <li> Bob cannot reconstruct the teleported state instantaneously because he has to wait for the classical bits to arrive</li>\n",
    "    <li> The speed of transmission is limited by the speed of light. There is no \"telepathy.\"\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"bobs-operations.jpg\" style=\"width:8in;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Alice is using a measurement basis consisting of the Bell operator state, there is a one-to-one corresondence between those states and her measurement results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob chooses his physical operation according to the results of Alice's measurement according to the following table:\n",

    "    <li> Choosing a measurement basis is like choosing orientation of a polarizing filter for light, or orienting a magnetic field for electrons</li>\n",
    "    <li> In a quantum computer, measurement basis is chosen by applying a quantum gate called a \"unitary gate.\"</li>\n",
    "    <li> To apply a unitary gate, you create a unitary matrix and pass it to the IBM software (the API). In a real quantum computer system, the associated electronics would prepare an appropriate microwave pulse and send it in.\n",
    "    </li> After applying the gate, a standard measurement is performed, getting one or zero, but the outcome is determined by the probability of the measured state being in one of the basis state.\n",
